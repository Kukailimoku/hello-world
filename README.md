learning basics of github.
never used this site before. i was a CS major in 1999 but changed over to theater, so i
haven't programmed since 2000. i learned the basics of programming from 1984 on on my Commodore Vic-20
and Apple BASIC using the computers at school. this was before the Internet existed in the form it is
now. returning to this at the age of 43 is embarrassing, but I am a teacher now and hope to refresh
some skills so i can help special education students learn about the cryptocurrency phenomenon and get
involved in it while the field is relatively young.
